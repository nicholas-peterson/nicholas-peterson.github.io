<h1>Year 2019 Plans, Schemes</h1>
<p>
Going to try and put a bit more structure around the areas I've been interested in. 
The focus of 2019 is going to be on some fundamental subjects, nothing too flashy. 
</p>
<h2>Some Likely Areas:</h2>
<p>
<b>Khan Academy Mathematical Review</b> - I always slacked off in math in school because I didn't really appreciate what it was going to help me with.
I've slowly reached the point professionally where Math is starting to really pop up more prominently. I'm planning on doing a refresher of sorts
through algebra/calculus, then proceeding on to ones I never took in school (linear algebra, multi-variable calculus, etc). Part of the motivation 
behind this is to gain a stronger grounding in theory for use in other interests (APL and functional programming mostly).
</p>
<p>
<b>APL</b> - I've been interested in Array programming for awhile, and recently bought APL: An Interactive Approach, 
with the intent of working through the examples abbreviated chapter notes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Emacs/Org-Mode</b> - I try to use Emacs nearly every week, and then fall off the wagon and fire up Sublime Text or VS Code for ease.
I want to love Emacs, but I feel it actively gets in the way of me getting work done in some ways, because it has so much fiddling with settings.
</p>
<p>
<b>Latex/Beamer</b> - Similar to my comment on Emacs. I admire a great looking paper/presentation created in Latex, but I seem to need to author one 
so rarely that tools like Word and Powerpoint always seem nearer at hand.
</p>
<p>
<b>Scala</b> - I have a background using F#, and have recently purchased the garden path Scala book, and just reading the first 100 pages or so, 
the similarity is pretty strong. I feel like much of the effort in learning Scala will be around the tooling and libraries.
